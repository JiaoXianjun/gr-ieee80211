# gr-ieee80211
GNU Radio IEEE 802.11a/g/n/ac transmitter and receiver.
Supports upto 2x2 SU-MIMO and MU-MIMO.

Receiver Design
----------
- STF gives trigger of LTF starting point and the CFO updating point by a byte stream.
- LTF if triggered by STF, it runs auto correlation to find fine start timing, give the starting index and accurate CFO
- LTF estimates channel and passes it to signal block.
- Signal block demod and decode signal field, further check HT signal and VHT signal A information and check correctness.
- Demod demodulates OFDM and get LLR of bits.
- Decode uses soft viterbi

How to use
----------
- MAC layer packets are generated by python.
- MU-MIMO: channel estimation, V and Q matrix are also processed in python. Q is then passed to GNU Radio for later MU-MIMO transmissions.
